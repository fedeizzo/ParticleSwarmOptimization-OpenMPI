  [*Particle Swarm Optimization*](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1995.488968) is an optimization algorithm for nonlinear functions based on bird swarms. It falls back into the sub-field of *Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence* and it was designed from a simplified social model inspired by the nature.

  A key concept associated with PSO is the role of genetic algorithms and evolution, the functioning is based on several iterations that aim to identify the best possible position represented as a point in a landscape.

  The goal of this project is to design a parallelized implementation capable of exploring the solution space in a faster way. This is done through the usage of two main libraries for *High-Performance Computing (HPC)*: *OpenMPI* and *OpenMP*.

  The effectiveness of the proposed solution is tested using the HPC cluster of the University of Trento among other implementations found online.
